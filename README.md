# cryptology

Basic cryptology program (shift cipher).

## Description

Personal project where I develop some applications from cryptology.
For the moment, only the shift cipher is available.

The decryption part is automatised using statistics. I use the total variation distance to guess which key the message is encoded (only with shift cipher).
